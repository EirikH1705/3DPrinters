# Fire protection system for 3D printers 

## Description
We want to delevlop a comprehensive fire protection sytem for 3D printers.
The goal is to make the system safe enough so that we can allow unattended printing in a public school in Norway, following national and EU safety rules. 

The system should be easy to replicate in similar circumstances and be resonably inexpensive. 

## Are some printers already safe?
Some printer manufacturers state in their certification documents that their printers are safe for unattended (overnight) use, Ultimaker 2 for example, if you only use their material and follow all user guides. Others make the opposite claim and say that an active printer can never be left unattended, Prusa i3 for example. We argue that these claims are not enough since we want to be able to use various printers, various filament and do some modifications to the printers. Also we are not yet comfortably convinced that the risk of accidental printer-fires is small enough.
